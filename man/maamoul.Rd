\arguments{
\item{global_network_edges}{A path to a file holding the list of edges to be
included in the global metabolic network. The file should be comma-
delimited, with the first column listing EC's and the second column listing
metabolites. Additional columns, if exits, will be ignored. Each row in the
table indicates an edge between the EC and the metabolite.}

\item{ec_pvals}{A path to a file holding all metagenomic EC features and
their corresponding p-values representing their association with disease.
These do not have to be FDR corrected. The file should be tab-delimited,
with a column named 'feature' holding EC codes in the same format as in
the global network file, and a 'pval' column holding the p-values. Other
columns will be ignored.}

\item{metabolite_pvals}{Similar to the `ec_pvals` file, but listing
metabolite p-values. Metabolite codes/names should be in the same format
as in the global network file.}

\item{OUT_DIR}{A folder in which all output files will be saved.}

\item{SEED}{An integer to be used as a seed for result reproducibility.}

\item{N_REPEATS}{The number of random coloring of nodes to perform.}

\item{HCLUST_METHOD}{Either 'average', 'single' or 'complete'. See `?hclust`.}

\item{MIN_MOD_SIZE}{The minimal size of a module to be outputted.}

\item{MIN_METS_IN_MOD}{Modules with less than this number of metabolite nodes
will be discarded.}

\item{MIN_ECS_IN_MOD}{Modules with less than this number of EC nodes will be
discarded.}

\item{N_VAL_PERM}{Number of node-weight permutations to perform for
calculating the significance of each module.}

\item{N_THREADS}{Number of threads available for parallel computing.}
